				<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					Figuring out how to size Boxes in a reasonable way was quite challenging.
					Just setting them to a specific size would cause them to run off the screen if
					the window size was too small, or to create a huge blank space if there wasn't
					much content in a Box. Ultimately, I figured out that I could do
					<span class="code">height: fit-content;</span> to make the Box automatically resize
					vertically. I could not figure out how to do it horizontally without the page
					becoming really ugly.
				<p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I already knew the basic structure of HTML and CSS, as I already did a little bit of
					it back in CS 261 and an into programming class in high school. Despite that, I
					learned quite a lot over the course of this assignment. I learned how to use the
					<span class="code">&ltdiv&gt</span> tag, I became more familiar with CSS classes,
					I learned about the Box model, and on my own I learned about
					<span class="code">fit-content</span>, <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> and
					escape characters.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were most helpful?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						W3 Schools was really helpful for learning about specific concepts and
						tags in HTML and CSS.
					</li>
					<li>
						StackOverflow was occasionally useful for figuring out some things, but
						StackOverflow's comments are often so elitist and mean that it made me reluctant
						to visit it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Surprisingly, the most helpful resource (besides the lectures obviously)
						was my IDE, IntelliJ Ultimate, which I got through GitHub Education.
						It really helped me to format my code and find errors and was constantly
						giving me suggestions on improvements and how to accomplish tasks.
						It even has text explaining what every single tag does!
