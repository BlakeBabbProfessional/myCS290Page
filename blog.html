				<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					Figuring out how to size Boxes in a reasonable way was quite challenging.
					Just setting them to a specific size would cause them to run off the screen if
					the window size was too small, or to create a huge blank space if there wasn't
					much content in a Box. Ultimately, I figured out that I could do
					<span class="code">height: fit-content;</span> to make the Box automatically resize
					vertically. I could not figure out how to do it horizontally without the page
					becoming really ugly.
				<p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I already knew the basic structure of HTML and CSS, as I already did a little bit of
					it back in CS 261 and an into programming class in high school. Despite that, I
					learned quite a lot over the course of this assignment. I learned how to use the
					<span class="code">&ltdiv&gt</span> tag, I became more familiar with CSS classes,
					I learned about the Box model, and on my own I learned about
					<span class="code">fit-content</span>, <span class="code">&ltspan&gt</span> and
					escape characters.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were most helpful?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						W3 Schools was really helpful for learning about specific concepts and
						tags in HTML and CSS.
					</li>
					<li>
						StackOverflow was occasionally useful for figuring out some things, but
						StackOverflow's comments are often so elitist and mean that it made me reluctant
						to visit it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Surprisingly, the most helpful resource (besides the lectures obviously)
						was my IDE, IntelliJ Ultimate, which I got through GitHub Education.
						It really helped me to format my code and find errors and was constantly
						giving me suggestions on improvements and how to accomplish tasks.
						It even has text explaining what every single tag does!
					</li>

				<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					What wasn't challenging? Aligning the images in the posts took forever, I just tried a
					bunch of random things until one of them happened to work. Getting the filter to stay on
					the left side of the screen and the inputs to appear on the same line as their labels was
					initially challenging, but then I realized I could just make them flex boxes. Getting the
					title to not have an underline took a while to figure out, eventually I realized I could
					use <span class="code">text-decoration</span> to make it go away.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I am now slightly more comfortable with flex boxes. I learned about <span class="code">id</span>
					and <span class="code">type</span>. I learned how to resize images slightly better.
					And I learned how to make shadows.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were helpful?</h3>
				<p>
					As always, W3 Schools was really helpful. StackOverflow was occasionally helpful, and the
					MDN web docs were great. IntelliJ also showed me link to a webpage that allows you to
					create shadows which was really nice.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I have to Google?</h3>
				<p>
					I had to Google how to hide underlines on links, how to select different types of elements,
					how to align inputs and how to turn the cursor into a grabber.

				<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					Figuring out everything to do with filtering was quite difficult, especially keeping the posts
					in order. I had to try several strategies until I found one that worked. Adding posts however
					was surprisingly easy, just time-consuming.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I learned all about manipulating the DOM, and how to read from inputs, and about event listeners.
					I also feel much more familiar with JavaScript now.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were helpful?</h3>
				<p>
					As usual, the MDN web docs and StackOverflow were quite helpful. The lectures were also super
					useful, I definitely couldn't have finished this without them.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I have to Google?</h3>
				<p>
					I actually didn't have to Google much, just how to read from inputs and how to check if a string
					contains a substring.

				<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					This was overall one of the most challenging assignments so far. Figuring out how to convert the
					URL into a usable filepath was surprisingly challenging, and figuring out how to handle 404s was
					difficult. I also just felt like I didn't have a great handle on how everything actually worked,
					which made the assignment more difficult.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I learned how to use mappings, which are neat, they feel a bit like enums from Java. I also learned
					that URLs are frustrating. I also learned that <span class="code">replace</span> doesn't directly
					modify a string, it just returns the modified version.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were helpful?</h3>
				<p>
					The example code was really the only resource I used for this assignment. Just studying and copying
					that was really helpful.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I have to Google?</h3>
				<p>
					Nothing. The example code was all I needed for this assignment.

				<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
				<h3>What was challenging?</h3>
				<p>
					Figuring out how to use Handlebars notation was a challenge, it is not very straightforward. It was
					made harder by the fact that my IDE, WebStorm only has partial support for .handlebars files.
					I also had a lot of difficulty figuring out how to interact with Handlebars with JS, but the example
					code helped with that.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
				<p>
					I learned all about Handlebars templates, which are super useful. I also learned about params in
					app.get, and about insertAdjacentHTML.
				</p>
				<h3>What resources were helpful?</h3>
				<p>
					The example code was the most useful resource, and the beginners guid to Handlebars article on
					Site point was pretty useful. StackOverflow was also a bit of help.
				</p>
				<h3>What did I have to Google?</h3>
				<p>
					I had to Google how if statements work in Handlebars.
