				<h3>My experience with Web Development</h3>
				<p>
					The most impressive thing I've done in web dev was
					<a href="https://blakebabbprofessional.github.io/BabbPortfolio/">this portfolio</a>
					I built using Bootstrap for a class last year. Don't let that distract you though, I actually have very
					little experience in web dev. I want to learn JavaScript, because at the moment
					I'm only fluent in Java and proficient in C, and I'd like to get a more rounded knowledge base.<br>

				<h3>Fun fact about me!</h3>
				<p>
					I am a game developer! I've participated in 5 game jams, where I make and release a game in 48 or 72 hours.
					I've worked alone and with friends, and it's always a good time, but a lot of work. You can find my games
					on Itch.io, and download them through Itch Desktop.<br>
