		<h3>My experience with Web Development</h3>
		<p>
			The most impressive thing I've done in web dev was
			<a href="https://blakebabbprofessional.github.io/BabbPortfolio/">this portfolio</a>
			I built using Bootstrap for a class last year. Don't let that distract you though, I actually have very
			little experience in web dev. I want to become more proficient in JavaScript, because at the moment the
			only language I'm fluent in is Java, and I'd like to get a more rounded knowledge base.<br>
			Yes, I have signed up for Campuswire.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Fun fact about me!</h3>
		<p>
			I am a game developer! I've participated in 5 game jams, where I make and release a game in 48 or 72 hours.
			I've worked alone and with friends, and it's always a good time, but a lot of work. You can find my games
			on Itch.io, and download them through Itch Desktop.<br>
