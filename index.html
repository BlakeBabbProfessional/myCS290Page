			Don't let that distract you though, I actually have very little experience in web dev. I want to become more
			proficient in JavaScript, because at the moment the only language I', fluent in is Java, and I'd like to
			get a more rounded knowledge base. <br>
			Yes, I have signed up for Campuswire. <br>

			I am a game developer! I've participated in 5 game jams, where I make and release a game in 48 or 72 hours. 
			I've worked alone and with friends, and it's always a good time, but a lot of work. You can find my games
			on Itch.io, and download them through Itch Desktop.
